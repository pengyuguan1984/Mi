        Xiaomi Australia: Covid-19 Announcement

        Please Note: Xiaomi Australia understands that Australians are going through tough times and we wish to make it easier for you. We are currently experiencing high volume of enquiries and orders, but we prioritize our customers’ health and safety first. Therefore, we have made some changes in our protocols to alleviate the risk of the virus spreading. There will be several delays in our dispatch of orders, but we are doing everything we can to adhere to the new management protocols for the COVID-19 situation.
        
        We are working around the clock to answer your inquiries and dispatching your orders as soon as we can. This includes additional work shifts, proper sanitisation and disinfection of Xiaomi Australia’s goods before delivery, and more.
        
        Xiaomi Australia truly appreciates your patience and understanding as we navigate through these trying times. We sincerely apologise for any inconveniences or delays we may cause in regards to your inquiries or orders, and we thank you for your continuous support.
        
         
        
        Stay safe, Australia.
